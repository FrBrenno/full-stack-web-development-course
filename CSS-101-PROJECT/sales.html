                    <p>R2-D2, pronounced Artoo-Detoo and often referred to as R2 (Artoo), was an R2-series astromech
                         droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton with masculine programming. A smart, spunky droid
                          who would serve a multitude of masters over his lifetime, R2-D2 was never given a full memory
                           wipe (apart from a partial wipe of select information by Cad Bane during the senate hostage
                            crisis) nor did he ever receive new programming, with these factors resulting in an adventurous
                             and independent attitude. Often finding himself in pivotal moments in galactic history, 
                             his bravery and ingenuity saved the galaxy on numerous occasions.</p>

                    <p>BB-8, sometimes spelled and pronounced Beebee-Ate and nicknamed BB, was a BB-series astromech
                         droid who operated approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. He had a dome head,
                          similar to that of R2 series astromech droids, with the bulk of his body made up of a ball
                           on which the droid's head rolled. BB-8 was mostly white, with some silver and orange on his
                            body, as well as a black photoreceptor. The droid belonged to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron,
                             whom he accompanied during his flights on his T-70 X-wing starfighter.</p>

                    <p class="identification_number">Identification Number: 822296</p>
                    <p>R5-D4, also called "Red" by Luke Skywalker, was a red and white-striped R5 astromech droid
                         owned by a group of Jawas on Tatooine in the early days of the Galactic Civil War. Shortly 
                         before the Battle of Yavin, the Jawas attempted to sell him to Owen Lars, but the droid 
                         purposely malfunctioned his motivator at the advice of R2-D2, so that Lars could purchase
                          R2-D2 in R5-D4's place. The droid survived an Imperial attack on the sandcrawler soon after,
                           and went out to find the Rebellion. R5 was still active by the time of the New Republic Era,
                            and eventually came into the service of Mos Eisley hangar manager Peli Motto. He projected
                             a map of Tatooine in order to assist the Mandalorian Din Djarin.</p>

                         assassin droid who was a bounty hunter during the New Republic Era. IG-11 was programmed to 
                         follow protocols of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and had a built-in self-destruct mechanism to prevent
                          himself from being captured while working as a hired gun.</p>

                    <p>C-3PO, sometimes spelled See-Threepio and often referred to simply as Threepio, was a 3PO-series 
                        protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol.
                         He was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone 
                         personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech 
                         droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history,
                          and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.</p>
